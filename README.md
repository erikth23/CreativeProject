# CreativeProject
Creative Project for CSE 154

Originally this started out as a project for my web development class.  It was meant to give us more practice with the different
languages we were working with.  It includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX, PHP, and SQL in the project. Since then I have continued to
modify and improve it and use it as a sandbox to try new techniques and skills.  I have used it to further my web development skills
in al areas, but specifically PHP.  As I continue to grow this project I will look to focus more on the backend as that is where my 
interests are.  If you wish to run the program you must set up a server and SQL database and run setup.SQL on the SQL database in
order to appropriately access the information.  Have fun looking through my project!
